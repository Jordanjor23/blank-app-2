# Airline Satisfaction Predictions

by Kelsey Woody

## ðŸš€ Purpose

The purpose of conducting this analysis was to clean data, visualize the data, model the data, and create conclusions based on my findings.

## ðŸš€ About the Dataset
The Shape of the ames data set is is [103904, 24].
The columns and rows included information about distance traveled, the ages of the passengers, numerical data about their onling expereince, and so much more.


## ðŸš€ Visualization Analysis 
I utilized scatterplots, histograms, and box plots to visualize my data and create a complete analysis of the data.The data was pretty much cleaned, so I began my analysis with selecting visualizations that would present a snapshot of the customer experience for different ages, classes, and flight distance traveled.
## ðŸš€  Modeling
The modeling techniques used are K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
The K-nearest Neigbhors model  train score was .92 and the test score was .94. So overall this model performed well.
The Logistic Regression  train score was .88 and the test score was also .88. After looking at the visualizations itâ€™s not surprising that customers feel equally as satisfied as dissatisfied across the dataset.
The Random Forest mdoel train score was 1.0 and the test score was .96. If I were to exclude outliers this could slightly change, but this model and prediction is also not surprising after looking at the data.




## ðŸš€ Final Thoughts

The airline satisfaction prediction project aimed to evaluated how satisfied customers were with different elements of the flight experience. The dataset included categorical and numerical data like online boarding, satisfaction, flight distance, class, and so much more. By modeling different categories of the dataset, like flight distance and satisfaction, I found that customers are likely to be satisfied with shorter distance rather than longer distance. The data visualizations support that customers under 60 are likely to be satisfied with their experience and treatment in airports. This dataset was very interesting and meaningful. The use case provided a real-world scenario where the data analyst had to clean, visualize, and model the data.
